    "text": "About\nThis Blender add-on enables the use of the python kernel that comes bundled with Blender, to be used as a kernel for running Jupyter Notebooks.\nThis enables a better scripting environment inside of a Jupyter Notebook in comparison to the text editor inside of Blender, while also enabling a notebook to take advantage of and control the advanced rendering capabilities that Blender provides.\nThis is a repackaging of the pypi project blender_notebook as a .zip installable add-on, which does not require additional python environments to install.\n\n\nInstallation\nDownload the latest release as BNotebooks_*.zip from the releases page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen the preferences panel by going Edit -&gt; Preferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to Add-ons -&gt; Install and select the BNotebooks_*.zip .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable the add-on by ticking the check box. Install ipykernel inside of Blender by clicking the Install ipykernel button (this may take a minute or two). You can then click Append Kernel which will register Blenderâ€™s bundled python as a possible kernel for use with Jupyter Notebooks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaunching the Kernel\nLaunch a new Jupyter Notebook, and select the registered blender version. This will launch a new Blender window, which will be running whenever the kernel is active.",
