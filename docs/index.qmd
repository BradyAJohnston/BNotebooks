# About

This Blender add-on enables the use of the python kernel that comes bundled with Blender, to be used as a kernel for running Jupyter Notebooks.

This enables a better scripting environment inside of a Jupyter Notebook in comparison to the text editor inside of Blender, while also enabling a notebook to take advantage of and control the advanced rendering capabilities that Blender provides.

This is a repackaging of the `pypi` project [`blender_notebook`](https://github.com/cheng-chi/blender_notebook) as a `.zip` installable add-on, which does not require additional python environments to install.

# Installation

Download the latest release as `BNotebooks_*.zip` from the [releases page](https://github.com/BradyAJohnston/BNotebooks/releases).

Enable the add-on by ticking the check box. Install `ipykernel` inside of Blender by clicking the `Install ipykernel` button (this may take a minute or two). You can then click `Append Kernel` which will register Blender's bundled python as a possible kernel for use with Jupyter Notebooks.

# Launching the Kernel

Launch a new Jupyter Notebook, and select the registered blender version. This will launch a new Blender window, which will be running whenever the kernel is active.
